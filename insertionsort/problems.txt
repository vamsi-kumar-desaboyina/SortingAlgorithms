1. Implement insertion sort to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
2. Implement insertion sort to sort an array in descending order.
**3. Modify insertion sort to count the number of shifts required to sort the array.

(e.g., return how many times an element was moved)**

4. Write insertion sort without using swap — only shifting.
5. Perform insertion sort on an array of strings and sort them in alphabetical order.
6. Sort an array of objects (e.g., Employee) using insertion sort based on a field like age or salary.
7. Implement recursive insertion sort.
8. Use insertion sort to sort only the first k elements of an array.
9. Given an array, print the state of the array after each pass of insertion sort.
10. Implement binary insertion sort (use binary search to find the correct position).
11. Given a linked list, sort it using insertion sort logic.
12. Sort an array that is “almost sorted” using insertion sort and return how many elements were out of place.
13. Implement insertion sort and stop the algorithm immediately when the array becomes sorted.
14. Use insertion sort to sort the digits of a number (e.g., 4721 → 1247).
15. Write insertion sort that sorts odd numbers first and then even numbers (both separately sorted).
16. Given a list of timestamps, sort them using insertion sort.
17. Implement insertion sort but track and print every comparison made.
18. Sort an array of characters using insertion sort.
19. Given a nearly sorted array, apply insertion sort and count how many elements are already in correct position.
20. Modify insertion sort to sort an array in-place but from right to left instead of left to right.
21. Write a function that returns the number of shifts performed by insertion sort.
22. Given a stream of numbers, insert each number into a sorted list using insertion sort logic.
