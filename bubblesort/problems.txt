🔹 Q4. Optimize Bubble Sort so that it stops early when the array becomes sorted before all passes are complete.           ==done
🔹 Q5. Given an array of integers, use Bubble Sort to sort it, and then print the kth smallest element.                    ==done
🔹 Q6. Given an array, check if it is already sorted using a single traversal using bubble sort.                           ==done
🔹 Q7. Write a program to find the second largest element in an array without sorting it completely using bubble sort.     ==done
🔹 Q8. Given an array of integers, sort the array without using any built-in sorting function (implement any sorting algorithm manually).  ==done

⚙️ Intermediate Level

🔹 Q9. Given an array of strings, sort them in lexicographical (alphabetical) order using Bubble Sort.
🔹 Q10. Implement Bubble Sort on an array of objects (e.g., students with name and marks) to sort them by marks in ascending order.
🔹 Q11. Write a program to sort only the even numbers in an array using Bubble Sort while keeping the odd numbers in their original positions.
🔹 Q12. Write a function using Bubble Sort that checks if an array is already sorted or not, without actually sorting it.   ==done
🔹 Q13. Given two sorted arrays, merge them into one sorted array without using library functions — and then apply Bubble Sort on the merged result.
🔹 Q14. Given two arrays, check if they are permutations of each other (contain the same elements).
🔹 Q15. Sort an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s without using any sorting function (Dutch National Flag problem).
🔹 Q16. Given a list of student marks, sort them and print the top 3 scores.
